# Excel-Rate-Calculator
Rate Calculator created in Excel

This is a rate calculator that I designed in Excel to compare rates from many different life insurance carriers all at once. 
The inputs are in grey and are: age, sex, nt(tobacco or non-tobacco), amount, premium (how they will be paying), height, and weight. Each carrier also has an input for 'level' which is which underwriting class the client would be with that carrier.

With this information, the quotes for each carrier will be displayed along with the minimum and maximum of age, insurance amount, and weight.
